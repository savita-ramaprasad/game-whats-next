You will be shown the first four terms of a sequence. You start with
50 points. You have to enter the fifth term of the sequence. If your 
answer is correct you win with 50 points. If you are not sure, you can 
see more terms. For example, you can see the fifth term and then make a
guess for the sixth term. Every time you uncover a term you lose 10 
points. If you give the correct answer at any stage you win with points
that are remaining. The game is over either when you have given the 
answer or have lost all 50 points.
